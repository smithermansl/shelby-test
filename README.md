# Clark Take-Home Code Challenge

## Requirements
Take a look at `src/data.js`. This is an approximation of what data from our API looks like once it has been normalized.

For this exercise, we'd like you to do the following:

- calculate the total amount billed in dollars
- calculate the total amount `paid` in dollars
- calculate the total amount `overdue` (pending status, due date in the past) in dollars
- calculate the total amount `outstanding` (pending status, due date in the future) in dollars.

Please render these values to the screen along with an ordered list of the bills sorted by due date and by category (outstanding, overdue, paid)

If you're comfortable, we'd love to see you use [Flow](https://flow.org/en/) to add type annotations to your work, but please don't feel that it's a requirement.

Feel free to use any resources and packages available to you, including [clark-utils](https://github.com/hiclark/clark-utils).

When you've finished, please zip your completed challenge and email it back to us (engineering@hiclark.com).

## To get started:

This app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get things running:

1. clone the project (`git clone https://github.com/hiclark/candidate-test.git`)
1. install its dependencies (`yarn`)
1. start the development server (`yarn start`)
1. edit `src/App.js` and save to reload.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us (engineering@hiclark.com)!
